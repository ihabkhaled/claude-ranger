# 00 - Request Intake and Classification

## Purpose

Classify the request before solutioning begins.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. Assign a unique request ID.
2. Record the request source and sponsoring team.
3. Classify the request type.
4. Identify affected domains and systems.
5. Assess severity, urgency, and whether the request is standard track or hotfix track.
6. Flag critical-risk areas such as auth, money flow, privacy, tenant isolation, reporting, or external integrations.
7. Assign accountable owners.

## Evidence And References To Attach

- source ticket, email, incident, request thread, or roadmap reference
- links to previous related requests if this is follow-on work
- incident IDs or support cases if this is reactive work
- named owners and escalation contacts

## Phase Blockers

Do not close this phase if:

- the request type is still ambiguous
- ownership is still ambiguous
- severity or urgency is guessed but not recorded
- critical-risk areas were not reviewed
- the request does not yet have a stable identifier

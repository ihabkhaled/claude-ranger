# 08 - Architecture Review

## Purpose

Verify that the planned solution fits the current architecture or intentionally evolves it with documented decisions.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. Re-read architecture docs, domain boundaries, workflows, and service ownership.
2. Compare the proposed design to current patterns and constraints.
3. Identify contract, ownership, data-flow, or topology changes.
4. Decide whether ADRs are required.

## Current Architecture Context

[Describe the relevant current architecture, services, modules, or platform components that frame the change.]

## Architecture Impact

| Area | Impact | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Domain boundaries | | |
| Service ownership | | |
| API contracts | | |
| Data flow | | |
| Event flow | | |
| Deployment topology | | |
| Shared libraries or modules | | |

## Design Pattern Fit

[Explain how the proposal aligns with or intentionally changes current design patterns.]

## Required ADRs

| ADR needed | Title | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| yes / no | | | pending |

## Architecture Risks

- [Risk 1]

## Exit Checklist

- [ ] Architecture docs reviewed
- [ ] Impact documented
- [ ] Pattern fit documented
- [ ] ADR decision made
- [ ] Risks captured

## Sign-Off

| Role | Name | Decision | Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Architect / technical owner | | approve / revise | |

## Evidence And References To Attach

- relevant architecture docs and ADR links
- diagrams, ownership maps, or data-flow references
- references to contracts or modules whose boundaries are affected

## Phase Blockers

Do not close this phase if:

- architecture fit is assumed but not explained
- ownership changes are still implicit
- an ADR is needed but was deferred without a decision
- cross-boundary effects are still unclear

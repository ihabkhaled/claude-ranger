# Company SDLC Policy

## Purpose

This document defines the company-wide delivery operating model. It applies to all software and system changes, whether the work targets a new product, an existing product, an internal platform, a shared service, a customer-facing workflow, or infrastructure.

## Policy Statement

- No phase may be skipped.
- Depth may scale by request size, but the gate itself never disappears.
- No implementation starts before phases `00` through `13` are documented.
- No merge happens without review, tests, updated docs, and rollout or rollback readiness.
- No release happens without QA, security validation, business validation, risk review, and release approval.
- Every phase writes artifacts into the repository.

## Scope

This policy covers:

- features
- enhancements
- bug fixes
- refactors
- migrations
- API changes
- database changes
- security fixes
- performance work
- compliance changes
- infrastructure changes
- workflow changes
- AI behavior changes

## Delivery Tracks

### Standard Track

Use for normal delivery. All phases run in order with standard approval timing.

### Hotfix Track

Use only for production-impacting incidents, urgent legal obligations, major security issues, or blocking business-critical defects. Hotfixes still require all phases and artifacts, but teams may compress meetings, use accelerated approvals, and complete documentation in near-real-time rather than through long planning cycles.

## Roles and Responsibility Mapping

| Responsibility | Typical role |
| --- | --- |
| Request intake owner | Delivery lead, PM, EM, or triage lead |
| Business owner | Product owner, business analyst, stakeholder sponsor |
| Technical owner | Engineering lead, architect, senior engineer |
| Quality owner | QA lead or quality engineering lead |
| Security owner | AppSec lead, security engineer, security reviewer |
| Operations owner | SRE lead, DevOps lead, platform lead |
| Release approver | Release manager, EM, product lead, delegated approver |

If local titles differ, document the mapping explicitly and keep it updated.

## Request ID Standard

Use a globally unique request identifier. Recommended format:

```text
REQ-YYYY-TEAM-####
```

Example:

```text
REQ-2026-PLATFORM-0042
```

## Severity and Urgency

Document both severity and urgency during intake.

### Severity

- `SEV-1`: production outage, material customer harm, security breach, or data loss
- `SEV-2`: major feature blocked, major degradation, urgent client impact
- `SEV-3`: moderate impact, workaround exists
- `SEV-4`: low impact improvement, cleanup, or planned enhancement

### Urgency

- `Immediate`: work begins now
- `This sprint`: planned urgent work
- `Planned`: normal prioritization
- `Backlog`: intentionally deferred

## Mandatory Phase Sequence

1. `00` Request intake and classification
2. `01` Business analysis
3. `02` Business development / commercial impact
4. `03` Product requirements
5. `04` Cross-functional refinement
6. `05` Delivery planning
7. `06` Technical refinement
8. `07` Technical roadmap
9. `08` Architecture review
10. `09` Impact analysis
11. `10` Engineering standards check
12. `11` Test strategy
13. `12` Coverage plan
14. `13` Implementation readiness
15. `14` Implementation
16. `15` Developer validation
17. `16` Internal bug loop
18. `17` QA validation
19. `18` QA defect loop
20. `19` Security review
21. `20` UAT
22. `21` Client approval
23. `22` Go / no-go
24. `23` Documentation updates
25. `24` Risk / compliance / ops review
26. `25` Release
27. `26` Hypercare
28. `27` Retrospective and postmortem

## Phase Exit Rules

- A phase exits only when its artifact exists, required sections are filled, risks are visible, and the named owner accepts the output.
- A later phase may refine an earlier phase, but it may not silently replace it.
- Missing information must be documented as assumptions or open questions, not ignored.

## Hard Gates

- No coding before phases `00` through `13`
- No PR without tests
- No PR without doc updates when behavior changes
- No merge below touched-module coverage threshold without waiver
- No merge if automation gates fail
- No release without QA sign-off
- No release without security sign-off when applicable
- No release without rollback readiness
- No release without monitoring and alerting
- No release without required business or client sign-off
- No release without recorded go / no-go decision

## Waivers and Exceptions

- Waivers are rare and time-bound.
- Every waiver must name the approver, business reason, risk, compensating controls, and expiration date.
- Waivers may reduce threshold or sequencing pressure, but may not erase traceability.
- All waivers must be recorded in the relevant phase document and in the go / no-go record.

## Required Supporting Baselines

Every team implementing this policy must also maintain:

- engineering standards
- code review checklist
- release checklist
- security baseline
- QA baseline
- UAT baseline
- risk baseline
- documentation baseline

## Success Condition

The policy is working when no release surprises QA, security, support, operations, or the customer because all relevant work was made explicit before the change shipped.
